            <h1>Bio</h1>
            <p>Amares is a chill, down-to-earth girl with a passion for the occult and the ability to predict the future
                through communing with spirits. She's a lover not a fighter and this is obvious given that she prefers
                using
                her powers only to keep herself out of harm's way or playfully messing with people, but recently she's
                had
                to use them to fight. Despite her mischievous streak and vanity, she's generally caring and gets along
                with
                most people thanks to her easy-going nature. Though at the bottom of the cast system of her planet
                Amares is
                seen very highly in the underground world of witches on account of her being the direct descendant of
                the
                most legendary witch to ever walk the planet, simply known as "La Brujota"</p>

            <h1>Appearance</h1>
            <p>Amares has long black hair that falls messily down her back, usually left unbrushed, giving her a wild
                and
                free-spirited look. Her skin is a smooth and unblemished light gray color as is the norm for her
                species.
                Her wardrobe consists mostly of black clothing, with a few splashes of gray or red here and there. She
                favors ankle-length skirts, often layered over fishnet stockings, and pairs them with comfortable, yet
                stylish gray sandals. Her crop tops range from simple black tees to more elaborate pieces, such as the
                pentagram strap croptop she's usually seen wearing.</p>

            <h1>Powers and Skills</h1>
            <p>Mediumship - The practice of mediating communication between familiar spirits or spirits of the dead and
                living beings.</p>

            <p>Spectrokinesis - Manipulation of ghosts, can use spirits like puppets and force them to fight.</p>

            <p>Potioncraft - Can create potions: substances with magical properties such as enhancing physical and
                mental

            <h1>Personality</h1>
            <p>Amares is a complex individual with a myriad of personality traits. On the surface, she comes across as
                free-spirited and unapologetically rebellious, with a tendency to go against the norm. She values her
                freedom above all else and refuses to be confined by societal expectations or anyone else's ideals. This
                often leads to her being seen as unpredictable and erratic, but those who know her well understand that
                this
                is simply a reflection of her innate need for self-expression.

                Despite her carefree attitude, Amares possesses a strong sense of empathy and is deeply attuned to the
                emotions of those around her. She has a natural gift for understanding people and is often sought after
                for
                advice or guidance. Her keen intuition and ability to see the bigger picture make her an excellent
                problem-solver, and she is often the one to come up with creative solutions to complex issues.

                Amares is a skilled magician, with a broad knowledge of various forms of magic. She has an intuitive
                understanding of the intricacies of the magical arts and is always seeking to expand her knowledge and
                skills. Her ability to see into the future adds to her enigmatic nature, as she often knows things that
                others do not.</p>
