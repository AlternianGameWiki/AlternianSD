            <h1>Bio</h1>
            <p>La Brujota, whose real name has been long lost to time, is the mentor of Cabría Dionis and Amares Aelius
            doubling as the latter's ancestor. She is a powerful and feared witch thought to have died centuries ago but
            rumored to be immortal. Though she has an extensive knowledge of all magical arts, she specializes in the
            creation of poisons and curses, a holdover from her formative years as a young witch. Despite her formidable
            reputation, she is a solitary figure who prefers to live deep in a swamp located in the woods, surrounded by
            nature and her fellow witches. She is a strict teacher who demands perfection from her students and seems
            deeply disappointed when they take a different direction from the path she went down.</p>

        <h1>Appearance</h1>
    <p>La Brujota is a formidable figure with a striking appearance. She has long, tangled knotted dark gray hair
            which holds any manner of strange objects such as sticks, leaves, and even insects, her slightly darker gray
            skin is telling of her age and is covered in a myriad of strange markings and scars. Her yellow eyes are
            deep-set and piercing with a glint of otherworldly power striking fear into the hearts of onlookers. Her
            horns are a bit larger than Amares' but retain their characteristic tight spirals. She wears dirty tattered
            robes adorned with bones, feathers, and other symbols of her craft.</p>

        <h1>Powers and Skills</h1>
    <p>La Brujota has a an extensive knowledge over all forms of magic</p>


        <h1>Personality</h1>
    <p>La Brujota is a complex and enigmatic character, possessing a rough and uncaring nature that belies a deep
            and powerful inner strength. She is fiercely independent and confident, with a sharp tongue that often
            borders on antagonistic towards those who don't mindlessly follow or look up to her. She has a vast
            knowledge of magic and the supernatural, and her experience with spirits makes her an expert in divination
            and prophecy.

            Despite her gruff exterior, La Brujota cares deeply for Cabría, treating her like her own daughter and even
            allowing her to take on her surname and symbol. She's a bit hard on Cabría, but her affection can be seen by
            those with a trained eye. La Brujota also has a soft spot for Amares to some extent, although she's
            disappointed with her kind nature and thinks of Cabría as her rightful heiress.

            La Brujota's connection to spirits runs deep, unlike Amares she has actually been able to communicate with
            them since she was a child, however they were the same spirits as the ones Amares would later speak to. She
            would ask them for guidance and knowledge about the future, living life the easy way like Amares but one day
            she messed up, she asked the ghosts how and when she'd die, they believed it harmless as it was IMPOSSIBLE
            to change fate regardless of how hard you try so they told her, this information made her sick, she hated
            it, she didn't want to die but she knew she could do nothing about it. That didn't stop her from trying, she
            devoted her life to it at first she hid her research and only asked them seemingly innocent questions only
            asking advice from them in a way where they did not know what she was planning but after a while they
            connected dots and demanded she stop, she didn't she had kept going hoping to find ways to break free from
            the fate that seemed to be closing in on her.</p>
