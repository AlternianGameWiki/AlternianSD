            <h1>Bio</h1>
            <p>Cabría Aelius, formerly Cabría Dionis, is a skilled witch who specializes in creating poisons and toxins.
                She loves candles and as a result is actually a skilled candlemaker and runs a successful candle shop
                from
                her house. Due to her time training under her mentor, La Brujota, she shuns society and prefers to live
                in
                the solitude of the forest much like her fellow witches. In true fashion as an heir to La Brujota,
                Cabría is
                definitely not known to be a kind person, only offering her services if she gets something in return,
                whether it be money or tradable goods. She has a tendency to hold grudges, and if someone crosses her or
                fails to pay her for her services, they can expect her revenge to come back 10 fold.</p>

            <h1>Appearance</h1>
            <p>She wears a red, hooded cloak underneath which her entire body, save for her head, is wrapped in
                bandages,
                giving her a mummified appearance. She has gray skin, typical of her species much like her yellow
                sclera,
                though her normality deviates at her pupils which appear as horizontally elongated slits, giving her a
                distinct otherworldly appearance. Much like her mentor she opts in to wearing makeup wearing red
                eyeshadow
                and black eyeliner with one downwards spike on each side, she completes her look with a red line leading
                from her mouth to her neck and her birth symbol painted on her forehead, adding to her mystical and
                magical
                appearance. Her head is crowned with spiral horns resembling those of some goat species, long enough to
                support her tendency to decorate them with lit candles and various trinkets like leather bands, animal
                bones, feathers, strings, and beads. Her hair is black and styled in a somewhat of a mullet with most of
                it
                being a bowl cut, except for the back which is left uncut and reaches down to her butt. Her eyebrows
                grow in
                a small oval shape, and she doesn't wear shoes, preferring to be barefoot even in the forest.</p>

            <h1>Powers and Skills</h1>
            <p>Pyrokinesis - Ability to freely generate, shape, and manipulate fire, the rapid oxidation of a material
                in
                the exothermic chemical process of combustion, releasing heat, light, and various reaction products,
                flame
                being the visible portion of the fire.</p>

            <p>Poisoncraft - Can create poisons: substances that injures the health or destroys life when absorbed into
                the
                system</p>

            <p>Candle making - Very skilled at making candles</p>


            </h1> Personality</h1>
            <p>Cabría has a prickly and harsh personality, often appearing grumpy and upset with a no-nonsense attitude
                towards those who cross her or do not meet her expectations. She is extremely confident in her skills as
                a
                witch and has good reason to, being a fierce and highly skilled pyrokinetic she actually has the power
                to
                back up her abrasive personality. Despite this she has a fierce loyalty to and love of her mentor La
                Brujota
                and feels a slight kinship between herself and her fellow witches.

                She is not one to hold back her opinions or not speak her mind, often coming across as a know-it-all and
                purposefully antagonistic to people who don't mindlessly follow or look up to her and her beloved
                mentor.
                Cabría can be somewhat vulnerable though a trait only seen when she's with her crush and childhood
                rival,
                Amares, who she begrugingly allows to call her "Diodio" a reference to her former surname, Amares to her
                dismay only seeing her as a little sister. To others she simply wants them to believe that she is much
                better than her. She is also fiercely independent, preferring to rely on her own skills and not ask for
                help
                from anyone but her mentor.

                She has a distaste for her own ancestor, who was a benevolent and charitable witch much preferring the
                cold
                and uncaring Ancestor of Amares shown by the fact that she went as far as taking her surname. She
                doesn't
                even know what magic her ancestor practiced assuming it was only fire magic as she has no interest in
                her or
                her teachings taking on poisoncraft instead.</p>
